# Bike Sharing Project For Des Moines

## Overview Of The Project:

This project is about exploring a bike sharing project in Des moines,the idea was resonated after taking a bike sharing tour of some key places in NYC, using Citibike.

Some key investors were interested in providing funding in the project idea and the data exploration for the viability of the bike sharing project begins.
This is an excellent business prospect, but the project iniciator have to think realisticly because the mechanics of establishing this project idea
in Des Moines might be different as compared to NYC.
The first step is to figure out how the bike sharing ride works in NYC. Hence a business proposal was created on how and why it might work in Des moines.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

# Results:

There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.
